Prerequisites
=============

  - GNU g++ >= 4.5.0  http://gcc.gnu.org/
  - libcutl >= 1.9.0  http://www.codesynthesis.com/projects/libcutl/

ODB requires the GCC compiler (g++) to be built with plugin support.
If you are building GCC yourself, you can enable plugin support with
the --enable-plugin configure option. If you are using a pre-packaged
GCC (for example, as part of your distribution), then you can verify
that GCC was built with plugin support by running g++ with the -v
option and then making sure --enable-plugin is present in the output.

Note also that for pre-packaged GCC, plugin headers are usually
distributed in a separate package, normally called gcc-plugin-dev
or similar. You will need to install this package in order to build
ODB. For Debian/Ubuntu, this package is called gcc-X.Y-plugin-dev,
for example:

apt-get install gcc-4.7-plugin-dev

For RedHat/Fedora, this package is called gcc-plugin-devel, for
example:

yum install gcc-plugin-devel


Building
========

The easiest way to build this package is with the bpkg package manager:

$ bpkg build odb

But if you don't want to use the package manager, then you can also build it
manually using the standard build2 build system.
