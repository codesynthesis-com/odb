# libodb-qt - Qt ODB profile library

ODB is an open-source, cross-platform, and cross-database object-relational
mapping (ORM) system for C++. It allows you to persist C++ classes to a
relational database without having to deal with tables, columns, or SQL and
without manually writing any mapping code.

For further information, including licensing conditions, documentation, and
binary packages, refer to the [ODB project
page](https://codesynthesis.com/products/odb/).

This package contains the Qt ODB profile library. The Qt profile provides
support for persisting Qt smart pointers, containers, and value types. Note
that both Qt5 and Qt6 are supported.
