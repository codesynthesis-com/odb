ODB is an object-relational mapping (ORM) system for C++. It provides
tools, APIs, and library support that allow you to persist C++ objects
to a relational database (RDBMS) without having to deal with tables,
columns, or SQL and without manually writing any of the mapping code.

This package contains the ODB examples. The following list gives an
overview of the available examples. See the README file accompanying
each example for more information.

hello
  A "Hello World" example that shows how to use ODB to perform basic
  database operations.

query
  Shows how to use the ODB Query Language to search the database for
  persistent objects matching certain criteria.

composite
  Shows how to declare and use composite value types.

container
  Shows how to use containers as data members in persistent objects.

relationship
  Shows how to declare and use unidirectional to-one and to-many
  relationships.

inverse
  Shows how to declare and use bidirectional one-to-one, one-to-many, and
  many-to-many relationships.

boost
  Shows how to persist objects that use Boost smart pointers, containers,
  and value types with the help of the Boost profile library (libodb-boost).

schema/embedded
  Shows how to generate and use a database schema that is embedded into the
  application.

schema/custom
  Shows how to map persistent C++ classes to a custom database schema.
